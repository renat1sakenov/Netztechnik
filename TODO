Todo:
	Use integer for temperature instead of float, so the read/write works
	Timer

Bugs:
	Timer is running to slow

Not so important:
	Don't update XLCD every iteration (less flashing).
	use different format.  hour,min,sec (3 Bytes) -> max of 256 hours = ~11 days
		use unsigned long (4 Bytes) for seconds -> 2^32 sec -> 136 years	

Nice to have:
	Show Time in double digits (00:00:02)
	Access EEPROM through buttons. (back and forwards).
	Access EEPROM through serial interface
