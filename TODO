Todo:
	Beeper when temperature is to high / low

Bugs:
	Temperature is written or read incorrectly. (converted_temp:float)
	Timer is running to slow

Not so important:
	Don't update XLCD every iteration (less flashing).

Nice to have:
	Show Time in double digits (00:00:02)
	Access EEPROM through buttons. (back and forwards).
	Access EEPROM through serial interface
